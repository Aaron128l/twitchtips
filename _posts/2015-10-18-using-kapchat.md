##What is KapChat?

[KapChat](https://nightdev.com/kapchat/) is a hosted site that can be used to add a Twitch chat to your stream using OBS or XSplit. It is designed to respect Twitch chat protocols in mind: chat badges, username colors, emotes and real-time removing of messages. With 8 built-in themes KapChat most likely has a design that will fit your stream. You can even customize fine details using the Full CSS Support. KapChat also displays all of your favorite FrankerFaceZ and BetterTTV emotes so you can never miss a KKona in your stream. 


----------
##Adding to Stream
Adding KapChat couldn't be easier with the streaming software of your choice. 

###OBS

Head over to the [KapChat](https://nightdev.com/kapchat/) page and click the green install button.

Kapchat uses a CLR Browser plugin which has been added with a batch file to make the install easier. After downloading, unzipping the file, install the plugin by double clicking the install.bat file. 

After installing the OBS browser plugin you now get to create your chat display. Clicking next on the KapChat Installation will bring you to a page with all sorts of customization. 

 - Username: This is the channel in which the chat will be taken from. **Use the channel name and not the Twitch link.**
 - Chat Fade: The checkbox enables or disables the chat fade option which will fade out messages over a select amount of time. This feature is very useful if you don't want chat lines stuck there until someone sends a message.
 - Chat Fade Length: In seconds the default time is 30 seconds, feel free to play around with these time settings. If the Chat Fade checkbox is unchecked you can ignore this option.
 - Show Bots: By default KapChat ignores bots. Custom bots can be added in the [BTTV Manager Page](https://manage.betterttv.net/channel), common bots (e.g. nightbot, moobot, xanbot) will already be recognized and do not need to be added. **Checking this will show all bot messages.**
 - Chat Theme: Select a chat theme from the list of 8. You can preview the display by clicking the "preview" button.

When all the settings are to your liking you can continue. 

A hosted URL will be generated and this will be copied to OBS.

To install:
Add a new source for obs and select "CLR Browser", give it a name of your choosing.

 - URL: Paste the Hosted URL generated by the KapChat page into the URL textbox. 
 - Dimensions:  If your unsure of a size NightDev suggests a `height of 600` and a `width of 300`. You can then edit these to your liking and placement in your overlay.

You now have a chat overlay in your stream! 

If you ever need to customize any of the main features (e.g Chat Fade, Theme) head back to the [KapChat](https://nightdev.com/kapchat/) site and get a new Hosted URL and replace the old URL in your source.

##XSplit

XSplit has a built in web plugin so there is no need to download anything. 

Complete the same steps in the OBS guide skipping everything OBS related, and get the Hosted Link. 

In XSplit navagate to Add -> Other -> Webpage URL. And paste the generated URL into the popout box. 

From there you can edit the size and placement within xsplit.


----------
###Custom CSS (Advanced)
If the default themes don't have something your looking for you can change them using Custom CSS. **Custom CSS is for advanced users and Nightdev will not offer support for CSS related issues.**

KapChat has provided CSS selectors for people to improve upon on the 4th page of the settings.

To access on OBS, click on the CSS tab at the top of the CLR Browser settings.

To access on XSplit, right-click the webpage source -> Enable Custom CSS Checkbox on HTML tab -> Edit CSS.
