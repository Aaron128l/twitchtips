## Chroma Keying Chat (deprecated)

*\*(BTTV Black Chat (Chroma Key) feature is deprecated in favor of [KapChat](https://nightdev.com/kapchat/), and will eventually be removed.\**
 
<br>For streamers who want to Chroma key the chat onto your screen without a background so it goes over games can follow the next part.
<br>
<br>First of all Pop-out the chat so you have it in a second window (The settings gear --> Pop-out Chat --> When the chat pops out do the same again --> Settings Gear --> Chroma Key)
<br>
<br>When you have opened it and Clicked on the chroma key setting you chat should look something like this:

</figure>
<br>
<br>What you then want to do is capture it in your capture program (OBS, XSplit ETC..)
<br>
<br>When you have the window selected and your region selected pick black #000000 To be keyed out.
<br>
<br>It should look something like this.
